## genshin-checkin-redeem.js
(requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey Opera/Chrome/Firefox extension)<br>
#### NOTE: Only the account that is currently logged in.<br>
Every 3h script will try to check-in<br>
If script asks to allow requests, click on "Always allow domain" or similar button.<br>
__Script will trigger when you are casually watching youtube videos, or just browsing__<br>
This script will send 2 requests, one will attempt to get checkin game reward, and the other request is another checkin<br>
I have tested it on other accounts and it should be working for you as well<br>

## quickfmg.js
(requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey Opera/Chrome/Firefox extension)<br>
Once you add this script and go to [emailfake.com](http://emailfake.com/), you would click on Logo that will have green background.<br>
Once you click on the Logo, it will copy the new generated mail automatically<br>
IMPORTANT: It will copy verification code for genshin impact account, no worries
