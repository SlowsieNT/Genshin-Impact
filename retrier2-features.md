## Features of retrier2
NOTE: Speaking of numbers, I did do math, and it turns out **around 60% of interaction** during AR5 reroll **is reduced**.<br>
- Cutscene skip REQUIRES NO user interaction AFTER logging in
  - You can interact after game is loaded
- Registration & Login is **almost** automated; requires CAPTCHA
  - Since 2.2, seems to require re-entering password, feature has been implemented (the day finally came)
- Auto click anywhere on "START GAME" screen
- Opening cutscene skip (twins)
  - (Saves around 50 seconds)
- Female twin will be selected, named & lastly confirmed
- Skips through dialogue by LClick
- Mini Waypoint Tutorial is 'skipped' by LClick
- When at first statue of the Seven, spams Escape key to exit map
- After red bow girl splash screen, 'skip' by LClick then swap to red girl by pressing 2
  - May not work at times, seems to work during every update of the script
- At Monstadt entrance, tutorial for navigation will be 'skipped' by macro
- [OBSOLETE?] Fend off Dragon DOES NOT NEED user interaction; for now
- Once Fend Dragon off is done, and talk is done, door blocked by Paimon is handled by the Script
  - You can now rest in **piece**
- Teleport confirmation is automated by default
  - **You ARE NOT SUPPOSED to open map UNLESS reroll is complete**
